# Visualizing data

In the iNterpret part of the OSEMN framework my goal was to create a simle dashboard with metrics of my choice.

For visualization I used:
* Tableau

I decided do show:
* Total revenue by month (as one of the main ecommerce metric)
* Revenue distribution by product category by month
* Total number of orders by month (in addition to revenue)
* Total revedue distribution by product category in each product line
* Total quantity of products sold by month in each categories
* Top 10 products by revenue
* Top 10 products by quantity sold
