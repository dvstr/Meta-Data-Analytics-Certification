# Data Analysis for Meta Data Analytics Certification

The tools I used: Spreadsheets, Python/Pandas/Seaborn, SQL, Tableau

I was provided the [csv file](transactions-pet_store-small.csv) with sales data, and I had to do **S** ([scrubbing.md](scrubbing.md)), **E** ([exploring.md](exploring.md)) and a part of **N** (iNterpret – [visualizing.md](visualizing.md)) of the OSEMN framework.

So my tasks were:

* Scrub the data
* Explore the data
* Visualize the data

### Scrubbing

While Scrubbing the data my goal was to clean the data and prepare it for exploration.

For scrubbing I've used **Google Spreadsheets** (cleanup functions and column statistics) | **Python/Pandas**

I've described my Scrubbing process and it's challenges here 👉🏻 [scrubbing.md](scrubbing.md)
And my Python code is here 👉🏻 [scrubbing.ipynb](scrubbing.ipynb)

### Exploring

While Exploring the data my goal was to explore the data for interesting patterns and statistics.

For exploring I've used **Google Spreadsheets** (Pivot Tables, SQL queries) | **Python/Pandas/Seaborn**

My Exploring process description is here 👉🏻 [exploring.md](exploring.md)
My Python code is here 👉🏻 [exploring.ipynb](exploring.ipynb)

### Visualizng

While Visializing the data my goal was to create a simle dashboard with metrics of my choice.

Here I've used **Tableau**

Visualizing process described here 👉🏻 [visualizing.md](visualizing.md)
And here's my dashboard on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/anton.bykov/viz/DA-Spreadsheets-and-SQL-Assignment/Dashboard1)<br>
