# Exploring data

In this part of the OSEMN framework my goal was to explore the data for interesting patterns and statistics.

For exploring I used:
* Google sheets Pivot Tables
* Google sheets SQL queries
* Python/Pandas/Seaborn

The Notebook with calculations, stats and plots üëâüèª [exploring.ipynb](exploring.ipynb)

While exploring, I calculated some common things:
* Totals (SUM)
* Averages and medians (AVERAGE and MEDIAN)
* Maximum and minimum values (MAX and MIN)

I added a new Total_Prise column and defined next things:
* Distribution of orders per customer
* Total number of orders by month
* Total revenue by month
* Top of all products by quantity sold
* Top of all products by revenue
* Top products by product line

Also, I made some comparsions:
* Total number of sold products in each category by month
* Category comparison by number of orders
* Category comparison by revenue
* Product line comparsions by number of orders
* Product line comparsions by revenue

## SQL query examples I used

Top 10 products by quantity sold with revenue
`=QUERY('transactions-pet_store-small_scrubbed'!A:L, "select D, sum(H), sum(L) group by D order by sum(H) desc limit 10")`

Top 10 products by revenue
`=QUERY('transactions-pet_store-small_scrubbed'!A:L, "select D, sum(H), sum(L) group by D order by sum(L) desc limit 10")`

Total number of sold products and total revenue by month
`=QUERY('transactions-pet_store-small_scrubbed'!A:L, "select K, sum(H), sum(L) group by K")`

Average price by category
`=QUERY('transactions-pet_store-small_scrubbed'!A:L, "select I, avg(F) group by I")`

Total revenue by category
`=QUERY('transactions-pet_store-small_scrubbed'!A:L, "select I, sum(L) group by I")`

Information of the orders where customer bought only one item
`=QUERY('transactions-pet_store-small_scrubbed'!A:L, "select B, K, D, H, I, J, L where H = 1 order by K asc")`

In fact, I didn't find any interesting patterns due to insufficient data. But I had good Python and querie practice.

I saved the result in the [notebook with calculations, stats and plots](exploring.ipynb).
